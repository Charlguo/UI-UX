Case Study 2

Problem: Revamp the current screens of Tavendi mobile app to a more modern UI/UX
Users: app users who are looking for a casual app to help them declutter. As such the UI/UX should be simple, efficient, and elegant.
Process: A lot of team meetings, discussions, brainstorming, drafting, and exchanging feedback/criticisms with fellow UI/UX interns and members dealing with the business and product side of things
